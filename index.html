            <h1>Four-Seam Fastball</h1> <!-- h1 BIG header, goes from h1 to h6-->
            <p>A fastball is a type of pitch that is typically thrown overhand and placed on the seams in such a way that
            allows for pitchers to implement as much backspin as possible so that it does a better job of fighting gravity
            due to the magnus effect. Higher spin and higher velocity fastballs have less vertical break and are harder to
            hit.</p>

        <div>
            <h1 class="Curveball">Curveball</h1>
            <p>The curveball is a secondary pitch type made to combo incredibly well with a fastball. Out of the hand it
            looks like a fastball but since it is thrown with forward spin, it dives to the ground much faster than a
            fastball and is made to get swings and misses. The act of playing a curveball of off a fastball's path is
            called pitch tunneling, since they look very similar for a large chunk of the way to the plate and then change
            their trajectory depending on the pitch.</p>
